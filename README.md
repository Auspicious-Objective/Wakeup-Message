### 2. Obtain API Keys  
- Create API keys for the required services:  
  - Weather: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)  
  - Additional data: [API Ninjas](https://www.api-ninjas.com)  

### 3. Set Up the Telegram Bot

## Motivation  

This project was born out of frustration with existing solutions like Samsungâ€™s information alarm, which often felt overly complex and required excessive phone interaction. I wanted a simple, no-frills way to get my morning updates at a glance, minimizing screen time while staying informed.
